# Smart-Mode Policies

## Option B Only â€” Codex First
- All Smart-Mode phases must be executed via Codex reading from the `main` branch.
- Local testing happens **only after** Codex completes and the repo is updated on `main`.
- PRs/merges to `main` should be linear (fast-forward) whenever possible.
